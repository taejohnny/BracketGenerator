# BracketGenerator

Developed using Java programming language and Eclipse IDE

This program is essentially a random bracket generator, which accounts for either 8 players/teams or 16 players/teams.
 * I wanted to create this program because of personal use in my daily life. Being a fan of sports and video games, there
 * are more than several occasions where my friends and I would want to compete in a soccer tournament (be it in real life 
 * or in a video game) where it would be difficult to find a way to face off against each other. Thus, I had this idea of
 * creating a bracket generator where, in the event of entering names in a bracket, those players/teams would be completely
 * randomized, making for a fun and exciting match up every time. Now, I am aware that there are many programs out there 
 * that due very similar functions when you simply type in "bracket generator" into google, but I wanted to go through 
 * the experience and attempt to figure out the algorithm and corresponding visual output of program such as this. I am 
 * happy that I was able to not only complete a program that I set a goal for, but that I can also use this in my upcoming \
 * late night college days
